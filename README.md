# Wedding Bar Calculator
Based on [A Practical Weddings Suggestions](https://apracticalwedding.com/wedding-alcohol-calculator/).

Uncertain of how many bottles of what booze you'll need at your wedding? No problem.

Input the number of people attending, how many hours your reception is, whether or not you're doing a signature cocktail, and what type of bar you're doing. Then, based on the suggestions from A Practical Wedding, I'll spit out some numbers for you to go on. These are only suggestions. You know your crowd better than I do.

Currently only works inside ghci. I'm planning on implementing a GUI in the future.
